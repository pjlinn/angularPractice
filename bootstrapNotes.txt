Grid System: Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

	- .container-fluid: Turn any fixed-width grid layout into a full-width layout by changing your outermost .container to .container-fluid.
